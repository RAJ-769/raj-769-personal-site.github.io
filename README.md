# 🌐 Raj Roy's Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website.  
It is a minimal, fast, and fully client-side site built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, designed to be long-lasting and easy to maintain without frequent updates.

## 🚀 Overview

The website serves as a simple digital identity hub featuring:

- A clean and responsive UI  
- A glass-effect profile card  
- Dynamic age calculation (auto-updates every year)  
- Generative AI like animation for the bio  
- Interactive light/glow effects  
- Social links 
- A small splash intro animation

No backend, frameworks, or build tools are required — everything runs directly in the browser.
